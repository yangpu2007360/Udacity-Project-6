Udacity Project 6 Data Visualization

Summary: This data visulization shows the departure delay time for each major carrier from 1987 to 2008.
         There are two main findings:
         1. Northwest Airlines has the highest depature delay time ever since 1996
         2. Average Departure Delay time increases for all carriers except for Delta Airlines

Design: I choose to analyzie flight departure time becasue I feel like it has been overlooked since people tend to talk more about the arrival time. 

        Dots chart was made so that viewers can see the data in each year.
        Line chart was made so that viewers can see the trend over the 20 years.
        Legands of the carriers are presented on the top left and the explanation for the abbraviation are next to it.
        Color of the legands are just randomly chosen. 
        As usual, X-axix reprent the year and Y-axis reprent departure delay time in minutes.
        
Feedback: 
          1: from my friend Yongqi Wen (non techinical)
          
          Add an interative legand so that users can slect the carriers of interests.
          Add the label to X axix
          Add animation when the graph appears
          
          2: from submission review
          
          Add the findings in text
          write out the full names for legends
          
          3: from friend Dachi Xu (Amazon Data Scienitist)
          
          it's not clear to see the lines if there are overlaps between them, making opacity variable depending                     on    user's interaction will improve the presentation
