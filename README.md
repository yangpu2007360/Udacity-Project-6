Udacity Project 6 Data Visualization

Summary: This data visulization shows the departure delay time for each major carrier from 1987 to 2008.

Design: I choose to analyzie flight departure time becasue I feel like it has been overlooked since people tend to talk more about the arrival time. 

Feedback: Add an interative legand so that users can slect the carriers of interests.
          Add the label to X axix
          Add animation when the graph appears
